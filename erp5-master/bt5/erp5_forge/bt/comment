* The glossary module "Update Workflows by English Glossary" Action uses DCWorkflow's API method "setProperties". In case of future patches or updates, this must be reviewed, as there is a risk of overwriting important data
* Software Release and Software Publication were moved to erp5_forge_release.
* upload_module has been removed since it was only used by Nexedi and it can be implemented better with DMS and caching.
