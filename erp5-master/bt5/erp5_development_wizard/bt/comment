TODO:
- code review
- separation of code and code templates
- naming cleanup
- merge into erp5_forge
- rename skin to erp5_development_wizard
- make sure actions take into account current context (ex. module, portal type)
- add a concept of "Development WIzard" in the user interface to prevent explosion of menus
