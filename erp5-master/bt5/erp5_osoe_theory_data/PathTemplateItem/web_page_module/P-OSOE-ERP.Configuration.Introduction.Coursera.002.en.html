          <p>In this presentation, we are going to explain how this lecture was designed. First, we define the goals of the course and especially what students can expect to learn by
             attending the course. Second, we explain the organisation of the lecture as a sequence of theory and tutorials that cover the different aspects of an ERP. Last we introduce
             the student evaluation process based on a case study and questionnaire.

        <h1>Course Objectives</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn universal and fundamental workflow of companies</li>
          <li>Understand what is an ERP by practicing an ERP instance</li>
          <li>Learn to perform a consulting process for an ERP implementation</li>
          <li>Being capable of configuring an ERP</li>
        </ul>

          <p>"ERP: Theory, Practice and Configuration" is a lesson which has four main goals.</p><ul>
            <li>The first one is to teach you the universal and fundamental workflow of the companies. By doing so, you will be able to understand how companies are organised and how ERP systems help companies to improve their performance by managing their business process.</li>
            <li>The second step is to see how the theoretical workflow is applied in an ERP. For this we will use ERP5 instances delivered to each student of this course. You will then be able to use it as companies do everyday.</li>
          </ul></p>
        </details>
        <details open="open">
          <p><ul>
            <li>The third goal is to teach how to perform an initial consulting process for an ERP implementation. We will show an interview example with the most important questions that should be asked to a company during this process. The objective of the questions is to identify those business processes which are not successful enough and which can be improved using an ERP. The objective is to understand how to set the priorities for an ERP implementation.</li>
            <li>The fourth goal is to teach how to configure an ERP through the definition of so-called categories. Since the configuration is made through a spreadsheet, no programming skills are needed and the focus is kept on management and organization rather than on technical details.</li>

            and a sample configuration case. Based on these materials, you will have to fill a last quiz.</p>

            <li>"How to fill the Category Spreadsheet" teaches you  how to use the answers to the questionnaire to perform an initial category configuration of ERP5 for the implementation field. Since the configuration is made through a spreadsheet, no programming skills are needed and the focus is kept on management and organisation rather than on technical details.</li>

            principles to the company of their choice, use the online questionnaire system and build their own categories.

        <h1>Reward: one more evaluation</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Prepare and configure an ERP</li>
          <li>Real case</li>
          <li>Fill the questionaire to perform the initial consulting process</li>
          <li>Fill the category spreadsheet to configure the ERP</li>
        </ul>
        <details open="open">
          <p>As a reward, the best students on Coursera MOOC will be offered... one more evaluation in the form of a personal coach. This coach 
            will guide them to configure an ERP for the company of their choice by filling an online questionnaire  and defining categories.
            The coach will help the student to improve its configuration until it has reached sufficient quality</p>
          <p>This online education process has been described in Dr. Klaus Woelfel's PhD: <a href="http://www.qucosa.de/recherche/frontdoor/?tx_slubopus4frontend[id]=20032">Automatisierungsansätze zur Unterstützung der ERP-Kategorienkonfiguration für KMU</a> (partly in English). In the mid-term, we hope that it can be integrated to Coursera platform, once the number of sample cases is sufficient.</p>
          
           <p>For students who can not participate to this coaching, they should simply study in detail the Zawee case and in particular how categories were configured for Zawee. </p>
