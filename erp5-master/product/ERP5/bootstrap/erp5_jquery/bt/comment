erp5_jquery skins folder is registered as PathTemplateItem not as SkinTemplateItem in this business template, so that sub folders can be handled by other business templates.
This business template is the refactored version of erp5_jquery, and the previous version is still available by installing erp5_jquery_legacy instead of this one.
