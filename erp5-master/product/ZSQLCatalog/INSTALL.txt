Warning

  This product is a proof of concept for hard core Zope developers.
  Wait version 0.2 to get something usable

Requirements

  You will need a MySQL server installed localy with an anonymous
  account on a test database.

Installation Instructions

  Download the ZSQLCatalog tarball::

    http://www.zope.org/Members/nexedi/ZSQLCatalog/ZSQLCatalog-0.1.tar.gz
    http://cvs.nexedi.org/ZSQLCatalog/ZSQLCatalog.tar.gz?tarball=1

  Install it in your local Zope product directory (ex. /var/lib/zope/Products on
  Debian systems). Untar it.

  Download the tempo demo file::

    http://www.zope.org/Members/nexedi/ZSQLCatalog/tempo.zexp

  and put it in your local Zope import directory (ex. /var/lib/zope/import on
  Debian systems).

  Restart your Zope system and import tempo.zexp

  You should now be able to play with the ZSQLCatalog in the tempo folder. It
  is possible to assign various ZSQLMethods

  - to create an SQLIndex

  - to update an object in an SQLIndex

  - to count the number of objects in an SQLIndex

  - etc.

  First check that MySQL is running and that the MySQL connection defined
  inside the ZSQLCatalog is OK. Then create a table to store SQLIndex data
  (create_table ZSQL method). Then update the catalog (*Advanced* tab)
  in order to recreate the SQLIndex.

  If everything goes fine, have a look at the example_report in order
  to see how reports can be generated by providing a dictionnary of parameters
  which is then used to feed a ZSQL method an retrieve objects.
