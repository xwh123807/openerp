This is a stub of the original itools library, containing only the
bare essentials needed for Localizer as used in ERP5. Namely:

 * itools.utils
 * itools.i18n

The intention is that even these few remaining functionalities should
be replaced by native Zope API calls.

The original itools distribution on which this stub is based is the
0.50 branch of the itools repository at:

https://github.com/hforge/itools/tree/0.50
