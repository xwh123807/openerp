Utility able to call wget and varnishlog to extract Headers and return all failures
according expected caching policy.

This utility is configurable through a configuration file like::

  [web_checker]
  url = http://www.example.com/
  working_directory = /home/me/tmp/crawled_content
  varnishlog_binary_path = varnishlog
  email_address = me@example.com
  smtp_host = localhost
  debug_level = debug

  [header_list]
  Last-Modified = True
  Cache-Control = max-age=300
                  max-age=3600
  Vary = Accept-Language, Cookie, Accept-Encoding
         Accept-Language, Cookie
         Accept-Language,Cookie,Accept-Encoding
         Accept-Language,Cookie
  Expires = True

  [header url=.*/sitemap]
  Last-Modified = True

  [header content-type=.*/javascript]
  Last-Modified = True
  Cache-Control = max-age=3600
  Expires = True

  [no_header content-type=(image/.*|text/css)]
  Vary = None

  [erp5_extension_list]
  prohibited_file_name_list = WebSection_viewAsWeb
                              Base_viewHistory
                              list
  prohibited_folder_name_list = web_page_module
                                document_module


with::

  url : website to check
  working_directory : fetched data will be downloaded
  varnishlog_binary_path :  path to varnishlog
  email_address : email address to send result
  smtp_host : smtp host to use
  debug_level : log level of this utility (debug =>very verbose,
                                          info=>normal,
                                          warning=>nothing)

  header_list : Key == Header id.
                value: if equals to True, it means that header needs to be present in RESPONSE
                       if it is a tuple, the Header value must sastify at least one of the proposed values

This utility requires wget => 1.12
And a callable varnishlog.
The utility must be run on same server where varnish is running.

web_checker reads varnishlogs to detect if a Query goes to the backend.
